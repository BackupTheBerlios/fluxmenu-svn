To install this run the setup.py script as root:

chmod +x setup.py
./setup.py install

It will place the main fluxMenu executable in /usr/bin 
It will also make a dir in /usr/share/fluxmenu-1.0 for all the 
files that fluxmenu uses. fluxmenu depends on libglade, and pygtk 2.4 or newer
2.6+ is reccomended. 

If you have any problems using this app please feel free to let me know how I can make
it eaiser to use. email: 
or see me in IRC on chat.freenode.net in #fluxbox. 
Removal of this app is not exactly simple as root: 

  rm -rf /usr/share/fluxmenu-1.0
  rm -rf /usr/bin/fluxMenu
  rm -rf /usr/lib/python(your version)/site-packages/fluxmenu/

and it will be gone.

Common problems after install
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
###################################################################

Sometimes people have said they have premission problems after installing
this is because of your umask. To solve the problem make sure all the
files installed by fluxmenu are world readable: chmod a+r 
Next the fluxMenu binary in /usr/bin will need to be: chmod a+rx

A test run of the install can be done as a user by running:

python setup.py --dry-run install

This will show you what is going to happen if you actually run the 
install as root.

Packages can also be made with the setup.py file. For more info on 
how to do that see: http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html
