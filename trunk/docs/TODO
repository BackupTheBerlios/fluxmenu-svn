TODO:


* Fix the drag 'n' drop so that dropping over items (anything but submenu or begin)
  wouldn't be possible (needs to write some kind of copy_tree -function)

* Menu and submenu sorting (by name?)

* Maybe a little smarter default menu on File -> New. Like the default menu on fluxbox.

* Maybe some list similar to denu's showing all installed programs (freedesktop?) allowing faster
  selection of programs and their icons etc, but still that select-a-file-by-hand should be there 
  like it is now.

* Buttons for duplicating an entry and also for moving an entry up and down. Cut'n'paste? Also
  external drag and drop from f.e. filemanager could be cool.

* Bugfixes :D
