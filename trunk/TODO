TODO:


* Fix the drag 'n' drop so that dropping over items (anything but submenu or begin)
  wouldn't be possible (needs to write some kind of copy_tree -function)

* Make the icon-selector dialog, that would show preferred icons
  (maybe using freedesktop's specs to find them?) and also all found icons in paths.
  I think the "all icons" could be sorted so that the ones that could be correct are
  first in the list. Like fbgm does the search...

* Menu and submenu sorting (by name?)

* Icons next to name in treeview.

* Maybe a little smarter default menu on File -> New. Like the default menu on fluxbox.

* A context menu for right mouse button on treeview, to show things like "delete" and "add->exec"?
  It should also have items like "Recursive visible" and "recursive hide", better names though

* Maybe some list similar to denu's showing all installed programs (freedesktop?) allowing faster
  selection of programs and their icons etc, but still that select-a-file-by-hand should be there 
  like it is now. I find it very intuitive...

* Buttons for duplicating an entry and also for moving an entry up and down. Cut'n'paste? Also
  external drag and drop from f.e. filemanager could be cool.

* Bugfixes :D
