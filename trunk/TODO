TODO:

* Fix the drag 'n' drop so that dropping over items (anything but submenu or begin)
  wouldn't be possible (needs to write some kind of copy_tree -function)

* Make the icon-button to work and also change the default icon (it is ugly and does
  not tell what the button is)

* Fix the Edit -> Undo -thingy

* Do the configuration-dialog and make it possible to save it and load on program start

* Menu and submenu sorting (by name?)

* Separator to show up as a line instead of blank  <= I tried the treeview's separator,
  it is no good because it cannot be selected. All separators would then be very static.

* Icons next to name in treeview

* Help -> About and all its subdialogs

* Maybe a little smarter default menu on File -> New

* Menu generation for debian, my own generator? and calling external generator.

* A context menu for right mouse button on treeview, to show things like "delete" and "add->exec"?

* Bugfixes :D
